      <h1>Help!</h1>

      <p>I often work alone, but I never really achieve anything alone.  I keep this page to be up-front about the help I could use, both to give myself a chance to think about it, and to make it known to other folks who might lend a hand.</p>

      <p>If you can help me out in any of the ways below, or just want to talk about the projects, <a href=mailto:kyle@kemitchell>send me an e-mail</a>.  Iâ€™ll get back to you quickly.  Thanks!</p>

      <h2>Public Domain Chronicle</h2>

      <p>The <a href=https://biobricks.org>BioBricks Foundation</a> supported me in creating <a href=https://publicdomainchronicle.org>Public Domain Chronicle</a>, a quick, easy, and free way for scientists to claim their findings and methods for the public domain.</p>

      <p>I would greatly appreciate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Intros to academic, hobbyist, and community-lab scientists interested in the public domain.</li>
        <li>Intros to IP attorneys at science companies, especially those already using defensive publication services.</li>
        <li>Intros to organizations interested in funding ongoing work on public-domain science.</li>
      </ul>
